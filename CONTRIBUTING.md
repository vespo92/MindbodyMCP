- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Your environment (OS, Bun/Node version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed functionality
- Any possible drawbacks
- Mockups or examples (if applicable)

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple fixes to get you started
- `help wanted` - More involved issues ideal for contributors

## üíª Development Process

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run dev
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Create a new branch for your feature:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Make your changes following our style guidelines
- Add or update tests as needed
- Update documentation

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the test tool
bun run test:tool

# Test with Claude Desktop
# Update your claude_desktop_config.json to point to your local version
```

## üìù Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Add types for all function parameters and returns
- Use meaningful variable names

```typescript
// Good
async function getTeacherSchedule(
  teacherName: string,
  startDate?: string
): Promise<TeacherSchedule> {
  // Implementation
}

// Bad
async function getSchedule(name, date) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### File Organization

- One tool per file in `src/tools/`
- Shared types in `src/types/`
- Utility functions in `src/utils/`
- Keep files focused and under 200 lines

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Log errors appropriately

```typescript
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch schedule: ${error.message}`);
}
```

## üîß Adding New Tools

### 1. Plan Your Tool

- Define clear inputs and outputs
- Consider error cases
- Think about caching strategy

### 2. Create the Tool File

Create `src/tools/yourTool.ts`:

```typescript
import { YourToolResponse } from '../types/mindbody';

export async function yourToolFunction(
  param1: string,
  param2?: number
): Promise<YourToolResponse> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 3. Add Types

Update `src/types/mindbody.ts`:

```typescript
export interface YourToolResponse {
  // Define response structure
}
```

### 4. Register the Tool

Update `src/index.ts`:

1. Import your tool
2. Add to `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler
3. Add case in `CallToolRequestSchema` handler

### 5. Document Your Tool

- Update `README.md` with tool description
- Update `Claude.md` with usage examples
- Add JSDoc comments to your functions

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Create a test script in `src/test-your-tool.ts`
2. Test various scenarios:
   - Normal cases
   - Edge cases
   - Error cases

### Integration Testing

Test with Claude Desktop:

1. Build and run your local version
2. Update Claude Desktop config
3. Test natural language queries

## üì§ Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation** - Ensure README.md and Claude.md reflect your changes
2. **Add Tests** - Include tests that demonstrate your fix or feature works
3. **Follow Style** - Ensure your code follows the project style
